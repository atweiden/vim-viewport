INTRO                                                         *viewport-intro*

Narrow region for Vim.

Makes a viewport on range of lines. Copies range of lines to new
buffer. Sets two marks in the source buffer, one marks the starting
position and the other the ending position. Writes modified viewport
buffer contents back into the source file with the vim |:write|
command. If source file was changed (in line range from which viewport
was derived), an error message is printed: use :write! to override this.

Source file can be modified outside of viewport, but be careful not to
delete the starting or ending line of the viewport, as this will remove
viewport's marks. Viewport's marks can be moved to new positions and
the viewport updated.

vim-viewport disables `t` and `y` as marks by default. You can use other
letters with |g:viewport_start_mark| and |g:viewport_end_mark|.

COMMANDS                                                   *viewport-commands*

                                                                   *:ViewPort*
:[range]ViewPort [cmd]

    Make viewport from lines in [range] (defaults to current line). Open
    new viewport buffer with [cmd] command.

                                                              *:ViewPortSplit*
:[range]ViewPortSplit

    Make viewport from lines in [range] (defaults to current line). Open
    viewport buffer in new horizontal split.

                                                             *:ViewPortVSplit*
:[range]ViewPortVSplit

    Make viewport from lines in [range] (defaults to current line). Open
    viewport buffer in new vertical split.

                                                             *:ViewPortTabNew*
:[range]ViewPortTabNew

    Make viewport from lines in [range] (defaults to current line). Open
    viewport buffer in new tab.

Commands local to the viewport buffer:

                                                             *viewport-:write*
:w[rite][!]

    Write viewport buffer contents into source buffer. Aborts and prints
    an error message if original line range from which the viewport
    was derived was modified in the interim. To override, append a
    bang (:write!). Aborts and prints an error message if starting or
    ending viewport mark in the source buffer cannot be found. Handles
    'modified': if the viewport is written without errors 'modified'
    is reset.

                                                                     *:Update*
:Update

    Update viewport from source file.

MAPPINGS                                                   *viewport-mappings*

vim-viewport does not create any keymaps by default. Instead, users
should create custom mappings with <Plug> keys. For example, to open
the visually selected region in a horizontal split, create a mapping for
`(ViewPortSplit)`: >

  vmap <leader>nr <Plug>ViewPortSplit

Available <Plug> keys include:

                                                             *(ViewPortSplit)*

Opens line range in horizontal split.

                                                            *(ViewPortVSplit)*

Opens line range in vertical split.

                                                            *(ViewPortTabNew)*

Opens line range in new tab.

SETTINGS                                                   *viewport-settings*

                                                     *'g:viewport_start_mark'*

Configure mark used to denote start of narrowed region (defaults to t):
>
  let g:viewport_start_mark = 't'
<

                                                       *'g:viewport_end_mark'*

Configure mark used to denote end of narrowed region (defaults to y):
>
  let g:viewport_end_mark = 'y'
<
